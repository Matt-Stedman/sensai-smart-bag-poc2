# Sensai Smart Punching Bag (Proof of Concept)

This monorepo contains two elements of the Smart Punching Bag.

1. The first is the ESP32 firmware -> this takes data from the Accelerometer and streams it over Bluetooth to the smartphone.
2. The Android application -> this displays the data from the ESP32 onto the Smartphone's screen.

Please read the respective readmes in each subrepo to develop further.
